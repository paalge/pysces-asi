Any executable files placed in this folder will be run by pysces_asi each time 
it creates a new output folder. The output folder structure is defined in the 
HOST MACHINE SETTINGS section of the settings.txt file. By default, a new 
folder is produced each day (at midnight UT), in which case executables in 
this folder will be run daily (as the name suggests!). However, if you edit
the settings file, such that a new folder is only produced once a month (for
example by setting the day_folder_format to None) then the executables in this
folder will only be run once a month.

Each executable will be passed the full path of the previous output folder as
a command line argument (in addition to it's own name as per usual), i.e. for
a shell script, the folder path will be ${1} for a Python script it will be
sys.argv[1] etc.

The order in which the executables are run is arbitrary.
