                      ## INSTALLATION ##
                      
Before installing pysces_asi you will need to install the following:

    * The Python All-sky Image Library (PASKIL), see: 
      http://code.google.com/p/paskil/
      
    * The PyEphem package, see: http://rhodesmill.org/pyephem/
    
    * wxPython, see: www.wxpython.org/
    
    * GPhoto2, see: http://gphoto.sourceforge.net/
    
If you are using a Python version less than 2.6, then you will also need
to install a backport of the Python multiprocessing module. This can be
obtained from http://code.google.com/p/python-multiprocessing/.

IMPORTANT! - When installing matplotlib (which is a dependency of
PASKIL), you must ensure that the "Agg" backend is available. Using
matplotlib with a wx backend with pysces_asi seems to cause problems. 
pysces_asi changes the matplotlib backend to "Agg" at the top of the 
main.py file, but no checks are done to ensure it was successful.

To install pysces_asi:
        
    1 - Unpack the archive: $ tar -xzf pysces_asi-2.0.tar.gz
    
    2 - Move to the unpacked folder: $ cd pysces_asi-2.0
    
    3 - Run the setup script. You will need root permissions to do this: 
        $ python setup.py install
        
The setup script will install the pysces_asi module into the 
site-packages directory of your Python distribution. It will also
install an executable "pysces_asi" (and "pysces_asi3 for python3) into 
(probably) /usr/bin. Finally,it will create a read/write folder for 
pysces_asi to use in your home folder called ".pysces_asi". The settings file 
that controls pysces_asi's operation will be installed into this read/write folder
and you should edit it before running the main program.


                       ## USING PYSCES_ASI ##
                       
pysces_asi / pysces_asi3 is controlled by editing the settings file, 
"~/.pysces_asi/settings.txt". This file is well commented, and should
be self explanatory. After completing the settings file simply run the
command "pysces_asi" in a terminal. If all goes well, a graphical 
window should appear. It is likely that you will see lots of 
exception messages in the terminal window used to run pysces_asi. If 
everything seems to be working ok, then you can ignore these as they
are probably being handled internally. To start running the camera, 
simply go to the capture menu and select "start capture". Depending 
on your settings, a new window may open prompting you for passwords
in order to mount your web-server.

When closing pysces_asi, you should be aware that it may take some 
time for the program to exit. However, if it takes more than 30s, 
then there is probably something wrong!
