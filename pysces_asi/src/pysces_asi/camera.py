The camera module provides base classes for controlling the camera, these are
unusable by themselves and must be sub-classed. It also provides the 
CameraConfig class, which is a data storage class used to represent a gphoto2
style camera config.

Since camera control is a pipelined process, the CameraManager class inherits
from ThreadQueueBase, ensuring that only one thread accesses the camera at a time.
